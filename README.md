# Zuber SQL Analytics Project

This project showcases a SQL-based analysis using real-world ride-sharing data for a fictional company, Zuber, operating in Chicago. Completed as part of the TripleTen BI Analyst Bootcamp, it demonstrates the ability to explore, filter, join, and aggregate data to generate actionable business insights.

## 📂 Project Overview
Zuber is a fictional ride-sharing startup looking to analyze trip activity, passenger trends, and the impact of external factors such as weather on ride patterns. The project simulates work done for Zuber's data team to support internal decision-making.

---

## 🧾 The Dataset
The dataset contains multiple relational tables:
- **rides**: trip start and end times, distances, and costs
- **weather_records**: weather conditions by time and location
- **stations**: start and end station info
- **trips**: additional ride context

Relational links between tables required creative SQL joins and time-based matching.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
1. **Startup Landscape Trends**
   - Counted closed vs. active companies
   - Found top 10 companies by deal volume
   - Aggregated raised capital per round type

2. **Ride Patterns and Weather Impact**
   - Analyzed how weather affects ride volume and trip length
   - Filtered data by weekdays and locations
   - Joined weather data to ride timestamps

3. **Neighborhood Hotspots**
   - Found busiest pickup/drop-off neighborhoods
   - Grouped results by time and neighborhood zone
